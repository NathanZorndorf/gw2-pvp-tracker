- always activate virtual environment at root before running any code
- always run pytests before moving on
- ensure code "compiles" and runs successfully and if it does iterarte until it does. 
- avoid putting code files at the root dir - try to use an intelligent folder structure 
- always create tests (pytests, or otherwise) for any functionality that you create in src/
