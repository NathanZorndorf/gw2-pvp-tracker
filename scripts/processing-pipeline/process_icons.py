# Take a set of "target" icon samples
# take a set of "Reference" icon samples
# Run them through a pre-processing pipeline to normalize size, color inversion, etc.
# For each target icon, compare it with all reference icons, find best match
# At the end, compare all ground-truth matches with detected matches to compute accuracy
